description = "Why does AI solve the Math Olympiad but fail to manage your calendar? General AI is not trustworthy in private settings because of three broken communication channels. Human to AI: underspecification (it doesn't know what I want). AI to Human: unexplainability and overconfidence (I don't know why it did that or if it's guessing). Environment: hostility (privacy leaks and security attacks). This course covers theoretical and technical background for these key topics in Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML). We conduct a critical review of classical and contemporary research papers and provide hands-on practicals."

## 1. Goal

1. Students will be able to critically read, assess, and discuss research work in Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML).
2. Students will gain the technical background to implement basic TML techniques in a deep learning framework.
3. Students will be ready to conduct their own research in TML and make contributions to the research community.

## 2. Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch coding.
- A pass grade from the Deep Learning Course (or equivalent).
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.
- Basic maths: multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimisation.

## 3. TML Book

Previous course materials are available as a book: https://trustworthyml.io/ (also on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08215)).

The book will be useful for the course. However, the course materials are updated yearly to stay aligned with the latest research, so it won't cover new topics.

## 5. Assessment

### 5.1 Grading

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Quizzes 1-5 (6% each) | 30% |
| Proposal presentation | 10% |
| Proposal report | 10% |
| Final presentation | 25% |
| Final report | 25% |
| **Total** | **100%** |
{{</table>}}

Quiz 0 is a trial run and does not count towards the grade.

### 5.2 Quizzes

- **Format:** Google Forms, accessible via QR code in class (link shared on Slack simultaneously).
- **Timing:** Strict 10-minute window at the start of class.
- **Structure:** 3 questions covering material from previous lectures. Attending lectures is essential.

### 5.3 Team projects

- **Team size:** 3 students per team.
- **Formation:**
  - Week 1: Interest survey.
  - Week 3: Teams finalised.
- **Deliverable:** 4-page report + 10 min presentation.
- **Peer evaluation:** Mandatory form at the end. Distribute 100 points among your team members based on contribution. Unequal splits will affect individual grades.

#### Example project topics

## 6. Generative AI Policies

Students may use generative AI tools (e.g. LLMs, VLMs, image generators). However, you are solely responsible for all outputs you submit. We will apply heavy penalties for:
- Hallucinated or factually incorrect outputs.
- Unsound or fabricated citations.
- Plagiarised materials.
- AI slop (low-effort, generic AI-generated content).

Severe cases may be reported to the university for disciplinary action.

You must be ready to answer clarification requests from the lecturer or tutors at any point. Inability to explain your own work will be treated as evidence of academic misconduct.

We do not tolerate very similar creative work among class members. AI tends to produce similar outputs across sessions and model families. Diversify your answers, especially for creative work. Suspicion of copied work will be penalised.

## 7. Communication & Logistics

**Lecturer:** [Seong Joon Oh](../../member/joon/)

**Tutors:** [Bryan Truong](../../member/bryan), [Seokwon Jung](../../member/seokwonjung)

**When:** Fridays 13:00-16:00

**Where:** 양재산학캠퍼스 대강의실 (Hybrid)

**Email:** `stai.there@gmail.com` for submissions, questions, and feedback.

**Slack:** Email us your name and preferred email address to be added. Use it for questions, announcements, and finding team members.
